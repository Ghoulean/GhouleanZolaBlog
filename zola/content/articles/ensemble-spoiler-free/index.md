# Introduction

**Just decks.** No gameplay tips. No explaining enemy gimmicks. Nothing. You take these decks and *go*. Good luck.

For those who just want deckbuilds and want to figure out gameplay themselves, this SPOILER-**FREE** guide provides various generic, easy-to-pilot, and community-tested decks. If you're wanting to smash the postgame as hard as possible, check the [spoiler-**FULL** guide](/articles/ensemble-spoiler-full), which contains additional gameplay tips and tricks to make the most out of every fight.

Note: this guide assumes you completed every reception and have multiple copies of every combat page and key page.
