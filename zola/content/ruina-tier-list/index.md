# Introduction

I play this game way too much so I'm ranking all the endgame key pages based on how I perceive their power level in terms of their overall and peak performance. I'm judging key pages as equippable key pages and *not* as attribution fodder, which deserves its own tier list. The rankings within a tier are not ordered. Lastly, I'm judging these pages based off the vanilla base game only as I don't play mods...plus mods tend to have their own ideas of balance. 

# Unranked

I haven't played with their key pages enough to give a confident assessment, but I'm still going to rank these based off the vibes I get from their base passives and exclusives. If you want to find an easy fault to ream against, it's in this section.

#### Good Vibes

- Lowell: Feels somewhat underrated with effectively +2 power every turn if you can emo level up aggressively, plus has a lot of attribution slots so can be built flexibly. Unfortunately his exclusive Forming Storm and Raging Storm Harm is clunky to use, but it's still a turn 3 mass at the fastest.
- Mei and Cecil: Has Fervor, in-built recovery, and the exclusive Tieshaokan deals a decent amount of damage.
- Rudolph's Mind Crush looks very powerful and Reindeer Treatment *could* be an in-built 2 strength...but hard to unlock that power without dying. Maybe good when paired with Offensive Position and Health Hauler? Survivor looks mostly useless.
- Harold is a tankier Hana Fixer. Trigrams is strong.
- Argalia

#### Bad Vibes

- Black Silence is underwhelming as a 1v1 duelist. Works okay in a team but then you're locked to Keter floor, which has Pulsation (great!) but no EGO pages for the majority of the game (bad!).
- Katriel and Denis are like Kalo but worse
- Boris barely has any passives but Discipline is funny I guess
- Martina and Bada charge passives are Fervor but worse. Sinister Strike feels like Pinpoint Breakthrough but worse. Sure you can run multiple copies of Martina, but then you're running multiple copies of Martina
- Chun and Miris are similar to Cecil and Mei with more powerful exclusives but no recovery. Their passives are interesting but recovery is stronger IMO
- Eileen has Nuovo Fabric, but you need to bring your own Puffy Brume
- Bremen and Greta have Nuovo Fabric
- Jae Heon has Puppet Strings at least, but not much else
- Why would you willfully inflict Pluto on yourself?

# Bad

#### Nemo
A Fervor sidegrade that requires constant Charge manipulation as well as an Unrelenting sidegrade that's arguably worse, as the healing expends all charge. Energy Beam provides a solid option against strong first-die and strong second-die pages, but you know what else can respond to those pages? For strong first-die, leading blocks such as Absorb Impact are easier to use, cost less, and mitigate the damage; for strong second-die, you can do something similarly with Sturdy Defense which also draws cards. Nemo is locked into a charge-spend build, and doesn't offer much payoff in return. At least his combat pages are pretty good.

A good Nemo deck probably looks something like this:

#### Irina

No intrinsic power, and her exclusive mass attack is difficult to obtain and plan around. At least she has Speed 3.

She doesn't really *do* anything, so Irina decks would probably look somewhat generic with survivability passives:

There's also a funny thing you can try with Yujin's Kizuna to activate a turn 2 mass, but this is higher risk, lower reward than just running Xiao:
