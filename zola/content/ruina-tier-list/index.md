# Introduction

I play this game way too much so I'm ranking all the endgame key pages based on how I perceive their power level in terms of their overall and peak performance. I'm judging key pages as equippable key pages and *not* as attribution fodder, which deserves its own tier list. The rankings within a tier are not ordered. Lastly, I'm judging these pages based off the vanilla base game only as I don't play mods...plus mods tend to have their own ideas of balance. 

# Unranked

I haven't played with their key pages enough to give a confident assessment, but I'm still going to rank these based off the vibes I get from their base passives and exclusives. If you want to find an easy mistake to ream against, it's in this section.

#### Good Vibes

- Lowell: Feels somewhat underrated with effectively +2 power every turn if you can emo level up aggressively, plus has a lot of attribution slots so can be built flexibly. Unfortunately his exclusive Forming Storm and Raging Storm Harm is clunky to use, but it's still a turn 3 mass at the fastest.
- Mei and Cecil: Has Fervor, in-built recovery, and the exclusive Tieshaokan deals a decent amount of damage.
- Rudolph's Mind Crush looks very powerful and Reindeer Treatment *could* be an in-built 2 strength...but hard to unlock that power without dying. Maybe good when paired with Offensive Position and Health Hauler? Survivor looks mostly useless.
- Harold is a tankier Hana Fixer. Trigrams is strong.
- Argalia

#### Bad Vibes

- Black Silence is underwhelming as a 1v1 duelist. Works okay in a team but then you're locked to Keter floor, which has Pulsation (great!) but no EGO pages for the majority of the game (bad!).
- Katriel and Denis are like Kalo but worse
- Boris barely has any passives but Discipline is funny I guess
- Martina and Bada charge passives are Fervor but worse. Sinister Strike feels like Pinpoint Breakthrough but worse. Sure you can run multiple copies of Martina, but then you're running multiple copies of Martina
- Chun and Miris are similar to Cecil and Mei with more powerful exclusives but no recovery. Their passives are interesting but recovery is stronger IMO
- Eileen has Nuovo Fabric, but you need to bring your own Puffy Brume
- Bremen and Greta have Nuovo Fabric
- Jae Heon has Puppet Strings at least, but not much else
- Why would you willfully inflict Pluto on yourself?

# Bad

I don't like these key pages at all. They're not even fun to play.

#### Nemo
A tempermental Fervor sidegrade that requires constant Charge manipulation as well as an Unrelenting sidegrade that's arguably worse, as the healing expends all charge. Energy Beam provides a solid option against strong first-die and strong second-die pages, but you know what else can respond to those pages? For strong first-die, leading blocks such as Absorb Impact are easier to use, cost less, and mitigate the damage; for strong second-die, you can do something similarly with Sturdy Defense which also draws cards. Nemo is locked into a charge-spend build, and doesn't offer much payoff in return. At least his combat pages are pretty good.

A good Nemo deck probably looks something like this:

<todo>

#### Irina

No intrinsic power, and her exclusive mass attack is difficult to obtain and plan around. Her light restoration passive should never affect gameplay if she's given a deck with a proper econ setup, and the restoration is little to even attempt running a deck without a proper econ setup. Multi-party compensation is likewise too inconsistent to be worth building around. At least she has Speed 3, and the debuff removal is nice if it ever manages to matter.

As she has no strengths, I would put her on Ominbrace Duel duty to maximize her own survivability. There's also a funny thing you can try with Yujin's Kizuna to activate a turn 2 mass, but this is higher risk, lower reward than just running Xiao:

<todo>

And finally, you can (eventually) create a constant light restoration engine for your entire team with Discard Multi-Party compensation. However, even when paired with light-hungry builds such as Binah, I still don't consider the amount of setup required to get this running worth the payoff. Especially since you can somewhat rely on emo level up for light restores until emo 5, and it's not demanding to include and play light restoration in your decks.

<todo>

# Niche

Key pages that I would only bring if, for whatever reason, I need to fulfill several specific, coinciding requirements at the same time. Or if I'm running through Ensemble.

#### Yujin

+1 universal power right from the get-go with no drawbacks is pretty good. Unfortunately, that's basically her only passive without a real drawback. The broken speed die is really rough for her as it always takes away what would have been her fastest die. Deflect Assault mitigates this weakness somewhat, but not much. This, combined with her Urban Nightmare-tier fragility, means that she relies on her team to redirect attacks away from her for survivability, which is not always possible.

Despite these shortcomings, her Overbreathing passive does have one niche usage that lets her be usable in SotC and above: as the majority of EGO pages are 4 light or above, she is really good at taking advantage of the light restore to cycle EGO spam. On floors with powerful EGO such as Malkuth, Yesod, and Hokma, she can do a lot of work.

She works best with Rapid Gashes, which still procs Overbreathing, giving her plenty of room to play EGO turn after turn while still dealing a bunch of damage.

<todo>

Boundary of Death is bad but funny, so of course it gets an honorable mention:

<todo>

#### Huburt

Locked Potential is a slightly worse Fervor sidegrade. He also has Speed 3 and 4 starting light. Decapitation is a pretty funny exclusive, though I think I'd rather just take Emotional Turbulence, Double-Edged Rencounter, or Duel instead as it's held back by its Blade Unlocked quest. Breaking Pressure is underwhelming.

Since I don't consider his exclusive worth running, there's no reason to use Huburt over Esther except in Ensemble. Although not technically mandatory, you're kind of railroaded into a Singleton build due to Locked Potential. 

<todo>

#### Gloria

Same as Huburt, except Easygoing Breather is somewhat better due to improving econ, and Eradication is worse due to its awful minroll and meh highroll; 12-23 is the second-worst playerside mass summation in the game (behind Tiphereth's Nihil). Eradication is also gated by both light and Blade Unlocked.

<todo>

#### Myo

A very strange keypage where she can grab up to +5 conditional power from Myo's Prowess, plus +1 again from Savage Mode. Feral Knives is also a very powerful combat page, though it's locked behind both Savage Mode and 20 charge. The Savage Mode quest isn't *too* bad as the opportunity cost to play it on turns 1 or 2 is not high, but the rolls are still worse than Will of the City's.

Myo has two downsides: firstly, that she only has three passive slots; and secondly, that she's railroaded into charge-based builds. Myo's Prowess pairs well with The Strongest and Maximum Crash, which costs 8 and leaving 1 passive slot left open. Charge builds tend to require including suboptimal clashers in order to build charge, so Myo has trouble managing card inclusions. Both of these are surmountable, but often the end results makes me wish I simply stapled Myongest onto another keypage.

A typical Myo build would look something like this:

<todo>

And a chargeless Myo build might look something like this:

<todo>

#### Maxim

A tank key page. Like Myo, Maxim is railroaded into charge; unlike Myo, Maxim gets access to Rhino Ram and Ground Crash. Rhino Ram's rolls are slightly but noticably better than Energy Beam's, and build towards Ground Crash's charge question. A 23-32 mass is nothing to scoff at, but the fact that Ground Crash expends all charge makes it awkward to use.

His extra tankiness and extra attribution slots lend Maxim to be more beginner friendly, but for the most part, I consider Maxim inferior to Myo.

<todo>

There does exist a cheese strat for Pluto involving Maxim, however:

<todo>

#### Philip (Ensemble)

+1 generic power just from touching someone that can even activate mid-combat is pretty good. Sadly, his lack of attribution slots restrict his flexibility, and it's hard to justify running Philip over those in the "good" tier.

Philip's decent as a generalist:

<todo>

Building around his exclusives turn him into a single-die maniac. Rekindled Strike is the second-strongest first-die 3-cost in the game (behind Onrush) that addtionally activates his Overheat passive and lowers the cost of Blazing Strike. Repeated use of Rekindled Strike can even make Blazing Strike an attractive inclusion:

<todo>

Lastly, there's this weird P Spacebar Tiphxodia build that uses Philip as an upgraded version of his Urban Nightmare version, applying burn in order to accelerate the fight progress:

<todo>

#### Tanya

Guts grants Tanya an extra health bar. However, even with Guts, in high-damage receptions such as DEnsemble, Tanya is still susceptible to getting both health bars bursted down in a single scene. So Guts is effectively a sidegrade to Immediate Repairs and/or Unrelenting. Beyond Guts and Nuovo Fabric, Tanya is completely passiveless.

Her exclusives on the other hand are powerful if you can play them. Due to their high cost, however, they require buildaround in order to see good use:

<todo> beatdown loop

<todo> bpp loop

#### Oswald

Splendid Performance is an inflexible Fervor sidegrade that really only gets to benefit Rapid Gashes. So Oswald is stuck on Rapid Gashes duty.

<todo>

There's probably a Funny Prank build for Climax floating around somewhere at least, but I haven't been able to find one that I'm satisfied with yet.

#### Bamboo Hatted Kim

His innate +2 slash power and Singular Slash alongside his UN-tier frailty and lack of passive slots leave Kim in an inflexible place where he can only effectively run either Burning Flash or Rapid Gashes in the late game.

Burning Flash is weak against mass defense and obligates Kim into taking Bottom Deal among one of his three passive slots...but hey, 2-cost 10-14 10-14. Works with Pluto's Might Contract also.

<todo>

Kim Rapid Gashes is somewhat worse than Rapid Gashes on Oswald or Yujin, but admittedly not by much.

<todo>

#### The Udjat

They're really tanky. That's...that's kinda it. They're good at tanking hits.

Due to this tankiness, they're good for generating negative emotion coins for Tiphxodia, Mountain of Corpses, and other abno page buildarounds that involve negative emotions:

<todo>

You can also bring three of them to bore Kali to death and deny her damage thresholds:

<todo>

#### Bayard

Bayard's whole gimmick is that he only gets to take actions every other turn via Ready Position. That should set off alarm bells immediately.

But he's actually insanely good once he gets his position ready. Nabbing +7 strength every other turn is worth the cost of not being able to move. Pinpoint Breakthrough's self-stagger can be prevented entirely via Grit, and stagger recovered via Mirage.

The biggest consequence of only moving every other turn is that he drags team emotion level, delaying potential powerspikes from abno pages. This feels especially bad when one of your teammates is running an abno-reliant build.

<todo>

# Good

Yeah, this stuff's pretty good.

#### Kalo

Self-sustainable draw with Bottom Deal, solid clashing, and massive paralysis/disarm infliction through ammunition. Kalo only has one build but it's a good one. He does run into some light issues at emo 5, but this is still managable with Stacking the Deck along with smart cycling.

<todo>

#### Esther

Same exact comments as Hubert and Gloria, but with two major differences: firstly, his exclusive Castigation kinda sucks, but secondly, his exclusive passive Raging Torrent is strong enough to bump him up from "niche" tier. The extra draw lets you play more aggressively during the first few scenes of a reception, letting you more aggressively lean on clashing with 3-costs and foregoing draw for a bit.

<todo>

#### Yan

Messenger is a strong supportive passive. Distorted Yan (passive) rarely comes into play as Yan doesn't particularly have any abno buildarounds, let alone negative abno buildarounds.

His strength comes from his unique exclusives. Baleful Brand is a strong 3-cost clasher and one of the few playerside Erosion applications in the game, with Erosion being a better Fragile (which is already a strong debuff). Lock is awkward. Distorted Blade is a strong mass summation that also applies Erosion, but because it's a 7-cost, Distorted Blade is only playable at emo 3 and above.

A generalist Yan deck would look something like this:

<todo>

You can also infinitely loop Distorted Blade using a build that's similar to Tanya. Duel used to help build emo level. Note that you should use Steel Knuckles *after* Brace Up or else you will discard Steel Knuckles's draw. Yes, that's how draw works. No, I didn't believe it at first either.

<todo>

Finally, there's Magic Trick DBlade. I think this build sucks because it's really clunky to use before *team* emotion 5. Great for YouTube montages. Not so much for anything else.

<todo>

#### Elena

Bloodfiendish is effectively Fervor and Health Hauler stapled together. I consider Health Hauler the number 1 most OP passive in the game (right next to Mind Hauler) so, y'know, that's pretty good.

I think Bloodspreading is not very good (comparable to Eradication; 17-25 is the fourth-worst playerside mass summation in the game), and Unending Thirst is a decent Raging Storm Love sidegrade. Unfortunately, it's locked to the third scene and beyond, which limits its effectiveness in multi-act receptions like DEnsemble.

But hey, hard to beat a built-in health hauler!

Build Elena generically.

<todo>

#### Donghwan

#### Allen

#### Yae
